I'm Ankur Sethi, a freelance software developer from India. This is my website, and you are reading it. Smashing!

I've hacked on everything from iPhone games to [file systems](http://github.com/GeneralMaximus/zfs-haiku) to [music players](http://github.com/goonj/goonj), but these days I focus my energy on the open web platform. I build websites and web applications using Python and Django on the server-side and HTML, CSS and JavaScript along with AngularJS on the client-side.

If you're interested in hiring me for a project, [shoot me an email](mailto:contact@ankursethi.in).
